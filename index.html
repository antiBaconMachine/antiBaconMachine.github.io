    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
    Hello my name is Ollie and I like web tech. I've been working as a developer and team lead in various fields for 12 years.
    I have had success and failure developing full stack web apps primarily using nodejs, but also Java. I have gotten excited about
    almost every new front end Javascript framework in the last 12 years. They have all ended up breaking my heart.
    </p>
    <p>
    Most recently I have been leading a team of 6 and focussing on mid/high level architecture and devops. I still love day to day development though
    and drop back into the team whenever possible.
    </p>
    <p>
    This year I have mostly been getting very excited about Kubernetes and devops for continuous delivery. It's very strange and sometimes troubling
    to see concerns like actual servers and networking melt away into a fuzzy implementation detail. As a developer in primarily high level languages
    this is a familiar and powerful abstraction which has unbelieveable pottential.
    </p>
    <p>
    I enjoy Cycling, board games and sci-fi, though my favourite book is the very un sci-fi Count of Monte Christo.
    Unless you count that stuff about him maybe kinda being a vampire.

    <h2>Experience</h2>

    <h3>Brandwatch, Brighton</h3>
    <h4>Lead Developer - Vizia, May 2017 - present</h4>
    <p>
      I lead a team of 6 people comprised of a mix of full stack and front end developers. We work in a high pressure delivery focussed environment where
      we generate a lot of MVPs to find out what sticks, and often throw them away again. Command Centers are a resonably new product segment and no one
      really knows what they should be used for which makes it fertile ground for experimentation. My role is split mainly between mentoring our hungy
      junior developers, improving / managing the technical architecture, and working with non technical stakeholders on the product roadmap.
    </p>
    <h4>Senior Developer - Vizia, Feb 2016 - May 2017</h4>
    <p>
      My first year in the Vizia team was spent rebuilding the entire product from the ground up with a microservice architecture. This involved a lot of
      trial and error. Microservices are cool but they have many pitfalls. I think we fell into all of them.
    </p>

    <h3>Mobbu, Brighton</h3>
    <h4>Senior Developer, July 2013 - Dec 2015</h4>
    <p>
      I came into this company a senior developer in name, and left with the experience to back it up. This job
      had it all, a great dev team who really drove the idea of an agile process, Management who weren't afraid to dream and fail, dramatic product shifts involving learning a new language most months (really) and
      a real big idea sensibilty. This job taught me everything good I know about workplace communication, mentoring and failing with dignity.
    </p>

    <h3>Senior Developer - CodingCraft, Brighton</h3>
    <h4>August 2011 - June 2013</h4>
    <p>
      I was a senior member of a small contracting team specialising in Java web tech. I was responsible for delivering solutions across the full web stack directly to clients with a focus on speed of delivery. Clients included Random House, local government bodies and universities. As a senior member of a small company my role was incredibly varied and involved a lot of client facing work, guiding customers all the way through the development process from quotation to specification to implementation to support.

    <h3>Java Web Developer - Editure, Brighton</h3>
    <h4>February 2009 - August 2011</h4>
    <p>
      Editure specialised in a primary education focused e-learning solutions. As the target audience are very young children it is paramount that simplicity and usability are prioritised. A key achievement in my time with the company was the design and implementation of an Erlang backed real time chat system with a JavaScript front end.

    <h3>Web and Flash Developer - Bright AI, Brighton</h3>
    <h4>August 2008 - February 2009</h4>
    <p>
      At the time of my employment this was a young startup agency specialising in flash and mobile viral marketing games. My key responsibility was developing flash games for companies such as BSkyB and Walkers.
    </p>

    <h3>Java Web Developer - East Sussex Fire and Rescue</h3>
    <h4>October 2006 - August 2008</h4>
    <p>
      A fantastic job to cut my teeth with at the start of my career, this position was characterised by intensive learning, primarily in the Java space, with plenty of mistakes along the way.
