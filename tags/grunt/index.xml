      <description>Grunt config files can easily become very verbose and disparate with related tasks scattered far apart. Without careful organisation and maintenance they can become quite unwieldy. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss some of the ways I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with to make gruntfiles terser and keep related components together. I&amp;rsquo;ll introduce the grunt-inline-task-sugar plugin which I created to implement some of the ideas discussed.
Anatomy of the alias task The grunt &amp;lsquo;alias&amp;rsquo; task type is probably familiar to you:</description>

      <description>Last year we migrated our build system for a multi platform cordova app to Grunt from ant. It was great. Well, actually it was just quite good. See, whilst I&amp;rsquo;m really not a fan of ant, the ant task graph is nice. It upsets me that I can&amp;rsquo;t express branching task dependencies in Grunt.
####The problem
In this case we wanted to do a bunch of common setup once then do n platform specific steps for n platforms.</description>
